## 07 — Apple: Gesture → Musical Control Signals

**Proof:** This mirror contains real artifacts committed to `outputs/`.

### What this proves
- **Signal ingestion:** human gesture data captured and quantified as continuous control signals
- **Modeling / logic:** gesture smoothing, normalization, and mapping to musical parameters
- **Orchestration / output:** real-time musical control signals driven by embodied user interaction

### How to run (proof)
```bash
cd 07_apple_gesture_music
python run.py
