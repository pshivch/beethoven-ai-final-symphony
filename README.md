- a runnable entrypoint
- generated artifacts
- domain-specific orchestration logic

## Mirrors

01 — Disney · Emotion → MIDI  
02 — Warner Bros · Narrative Tension → Tempo

### Orchestration Trilogy

Together, these mirrors form a single orchestration engine across three stages:

**Perception** — signal extraction from emotion, narrative, gesture, and telemetry  
**Intelligence** — modeling, reasoning, and decision-making  
**Orchestration** — execution under real-world constraints  

Each mirror is a completed, runnable pipeline with generated artifacts.
