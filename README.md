# 🎼 Beethoven AI: Final Symphony

*A groundbreaking project merging Beethoven’s timeless genius with modern AI technology to redefine symphonic composition.*

---

## 📖 Overview

**Beethoven AI: Final Symphony** explores the frontier where computer science, musicology, and creativity converge.  
The project applies five AI-driven pillars of orchestration, mapped to Beethoven’s style and spirit:

- 🎼 **Computer Vision (CV):** analyzing manuscripts, scores, and digital archives to extract phrasing, dynamics, and thematic nuance.  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning (ML):** training authenticity models to safeguard harmonic language, rhythm, and stylistic depth aligned with Beethoven’s ethos.  
- 🎮 **Game-Theory:** enabling real-time co-creation loops where AI and humans dynamically collaborate on symphonic development.  
- ⚙️ **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** orchestrating workflows for rehearsal prep, part extraction, and scheduling – scaling production while preserving quality.  
- 🧮 **Algorithms & OOP:** recursive structures and object-oriented programming to model rhythmic complexity, counterpoint, and metric modulation.  

This fusion ensures compositions that are **rigorous, emotionally resonant, and stylistically authentic**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, R, C++, Swift, Julia  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, SwiftUI  
- **Automation:** UiPath, Automation Anywhere for orchestration workflows  
- **Collaboration:** GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, RPA pipelines

## 🎵 Inspiration

Beethoven’s unfinished sketches represent **an artistic genius halted by mortality**.  
This project asks: *what if AI could help finish the symphony?*

It’s not just about generating notes — it’s about:

- Honoring Beethoven’s spirit through **stylistically authentic AI tools**  
- Creating a **testbed for human–AI co-creation**  
- Showing how **computer science + musicology** can merge into new symphonic forms
