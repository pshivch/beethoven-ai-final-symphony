# 🎼 Beethoven AI: Final Symphony

An AI orchestration portfolio translating musical intelligence into executable systems.

This repository contains **10 executed AI mirrors**, each with:
- a runnable entrypoint
- generated artifacts
- domain-specific orchestration logic

## Mirrors

01 — Disney · Emotion → MIDI  
02 — Warner Bros · Narrative Tension → Tempo  
03 — Sony · Multi-Agent Composer Duel  
04 — NBCUniversal · Motif Recommendation  
05 — Paramount · Archive Restoration  
06 — Netflix · Orchestral Storytelling  
07 — Apple · Gesture → Music Systems  
08 — Boeing · RPA Aerospace Ops  
09 — Northrop Grumman · Autonomous Control  
10 — NASA · Telemetry → Orchestration

Together, these systems form a single orchestration engine expressed across three stages of maturity: perception (signal extraction from emotion, narrative, gesture, and telemetry), intelligence (reasoning, learning, and decision-making), and orchestration (execution under real-world constraints). Each mirror is a completed, runnable pipeline with generated artifacts.
