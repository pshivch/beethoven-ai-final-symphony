# 🎼 Beethoven AI: Final Symphony

*A groundbreaking project merging Beethoven’s timeless genius with modern AI technology to redefine symphonic composition.*

---

## 📖 Overview

**Beethoven AI: Final Symphony** explores the frontier where computer science, musicology, and creativity converge.  
The project applies five AI-driven pillars of orchestration, mapped to Beethoven’s style and spirit:

- 🎼 **Computer Vision (CV):** analyzing manuscripts, scores, and digital archives to extract phrasing, dynamics, and thematic nuance.  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning (ML):** training authenticity models to safeguard harmonic language, rhythm, and stylistic depth aligned with Beethoven’s ethos.  
- 🎮 **Game-Theory:** enabling real-time co-creation loops where AI and humans dynamically collaborate on symphonic development.  
- ⚙️ **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** orchestrating workflows for rehearsal prep, part extraction, and scheduling – scaling production while preserving quality.  
- 🧮 **Algorithms & OOP:** recursive structures and object-oriented programming to model rhythmic complexity, counterpoint, and metric modulation.  

This fusion ensures compositions that are **rigorous, emotionally resonant, and stylistically authentic**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, R, C++, Swift, Julia  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, SwiftUI  
- **Automation:** UiPath, Automation Anywhere for orchestration workflows  
- **Collaboration:** GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, RPA pipelines

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [ ] Upload sample CV notebooks for score/style analysis  
- [ ] Release ML models trained on Beethoven’s repertoire  
- [ ] Prototype interactive game-theory co-creation loop  
- [ ] Automate orchestration workflows via RPA scripts  
- [ ] Generate demo symphonic fragments + final showcase performance  

---

## 🎵 Inspiration

Beethoven’s unfinished sketches represent **artistic genius halted by mortality.**  
This project asks: *what if AI could help finish the symphony?*

It’s not just about generating notes – it’s about:

- Honoring Beethoven’s spirit through **stylistically authentic AI tools**  
- Creating a **testbed for human–AI co-creation**  
- Showing how **computer science + musicology** can merge into new symphonic forms

# 🎼 Beethoven AI: Symphonic Co-Creation with Machine Learning & Human Creativity  

## 🎼 Project Overview

**Beethoven AI** explores human–AI symphonic co-creation — honoring Beethoven’s spirit through modern computational tools.  
The pipeline integrates **motif extraction**, **gesture control**, and **symbolic synthesis** to reimagine orchestration workflows.  
Current notebooks are **prototype demos** (proof-of-concept), actively evolving toward a full orchestration pipeline. 🚀  

## 📦 Dependencies

To install the core dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

💡 *Tip: Use Python 3.9+ and a virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`) for best compatibility.*
