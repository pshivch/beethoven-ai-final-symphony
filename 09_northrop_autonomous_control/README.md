## 09 — Northrop Grumman: Autonomous Control → Safety-Critical Orchestration

**Proof:** This mirror contains real artifacts committed to `outputs/`.

### What this proves
- **Signal ingestion:** autonomous system state, sensor inputs, and control feedback time-series
- **Modeling / logic:** control policy evaluation, state transition analysis, and safety constraint enforcement
- **Orchestration / output:** structured control signals enabling safe, autonomous decision-making under operational constraints

### How to run (proof)
```bash
cd 09_northrop_autonomous_control
python run.py
