# 05 — Paramount: Content Dynamics → Engagement Signals

**Proof:** This mirror contains real generated artifacts committed to `outputs/`.

## What this proves

- **Signal:** content interaction & engagement time-series
- **Model:** aggregation, normalization, simple temporal dynamics
- **Output:** structured engagement signals for downstream orchestration decisions

This mirror demonstrates how engagement signals evolve over time and can be mapped
into orchestration logic for adaptive content systems.

## How to run (proof)

```bash
cd 05_paramount_content_dynamics
python run.py
