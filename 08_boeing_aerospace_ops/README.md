## 08 — Boeing: Aerospace Operations → Constraint-Aware Orchestration

**Proof:** This mirror contains real artifacts committed to `outputs/`.

### What this proves
- **Signal ingestion:** aerospace operational telemetry and system state time-series
- **Modeling / logic:** aggregation, constraint evaluation, and operational state analysis
- **Orchestration / output:** structured control signals supporting safe, constraint-aware operational decisions

### How to run (proof)
```bash
cd 08_boeing_aerospace_ops
python run.py
