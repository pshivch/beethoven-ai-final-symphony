## 10 — NASA: Telemetry → Mission-Aware Orchestration

**Proof:** This mirror contains real artifacts committed to `outputs/`.

### What this proves
- **Signal ingestion:** spacecraft telemetry streams and mission state time-series
- **Modeling / logic:** aggregation, normalization, and anomaly-aware telemetry analysis
- **Orchestration / output:** structured control signals supporting mission monitoring and adaptive orchestration

### How to run (proof)
```bash
cd 10_nasa_telemetry_orchestration
python run.py
